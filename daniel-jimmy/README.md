# SQL Intro and postgres

**Author**: Jimmy Chang and Daniel Shelton
**Version**: 1.0.2 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application allows us to view, update, add, and delete items from a database table.

## Getting Started
A user must first have node.js installed. Then they need to do "npm init" to set up a package.json. After that the user installs express.js and its corresponding modules with "npm i --save express". We add a const called pg which is "require('pg')". We establish our conString to work with our postgres (including passwords). We set up the pg.client with our postgres port route. This then connects to our database.

## Architecture
Node.js, Express.js, JS, CSS, HTML, Handlebars.js, jQuery, postgreSQL
